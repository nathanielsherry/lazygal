Ideas to improve Lazygal (in no particular order)

* better i18n in templates : better string extractor and use of Translator to
  make syntax nicer.
    Work to be done in lazygal/tpl.py and mainly in devscripts/update-po .
    See http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/i18n.html
    and http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/ApiDocs/genshi.filters.i18n

* SMP support, perhaps using parallel python (http://www.parallelpython.com/)
  though not sure about its ability to transmit MakeObject.build. Perhaps
  os.fork() would be a better alternative.
    Work to be done mostly in lazygal/make.py

* Add some styles to the default theme.

* Integrate Gallerific

* Archive (zip) link on directory index.

* --exclude to exclude directories from processing.

* Transcode to VP8 (WebM) instead of Ogg/Theora. Copy webM files instead of
  transcoding.

* Per directory config file.

* Warn if config file contains unknown options.

* Document configuration file options.

* Document input formats.

* xinclude for XHTML <head />
