Ideas to improve Lazygal (in no particular order)

* better i18n in templates : better string extractor and use of Translator to
  make syntax nicer.
    Work to be done in lazygal/tpl.py and mainly in devscripts/update-po .
    See http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/i18n.html
    and http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/ApiDocs/genshi.filters.i18n

* SMP support, perhaps using parallel python (http://www.parallelpython.com/)
  though not sure about its ability to transmit MakeObject.build. Perhaps
  os.fork() would be a better alternative.
    Work to be done mostly in lazygal/make.py

* Add some styles to the default theme.

* Remove feed rel link in templates when there is no feed.

* Integrate Gallerific

* Better video thumbnails :

* Make it possible to input multiple source_dirs on the command line.

* Archive (zip) link on directory index.

* --exclude to exclude directories from processing.
