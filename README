Lazygal
=======

lazygal is another static web gallery generator written in Python.

It can be summed up by the following features :

    * Command line based (thus scriptable).
    * Reusable engine (to make a GUI for instance).
    * Lazy : do not build what's already there. There is still stuff to
      do in this area (especially regarding directory and templates
      modification time), but lazygal is already quite lazy.
    * Recursive : generates subgalleries.
    * Does not change your original pictures directories (the source
      argument).
    * Tells you what should not be in your generated directories (and
      delete it if you want to).
    * Can generate multiple sizes to browse pictures according to your
      screen.
    * Sort pictures in the same directory by EXIF date if available,
      else file modification time.
    * Theming.
    * XHTML and CSS compliance for provided themes.
    * Support for album meta data.

Configuration
-------------

In addition to command line, you can specify parameters in configuration files.
Configuration files are looked up as follows, the next taking precedence for already declared variables over the previous :
    1) Lazygals's defaults.
    2) ~/.lazygal/config
    3) %SOURCE_DIR/.lazygal
    4) command line.

Example configuration file :

[lazygal]
theme = image-index
clean-destination = Yes
image-size = medium=1024x685,small=640x428
thumbnail-size = 150x100
quality = 90

Additionally you can define template variables in special section
[template-vars], for example:

[template-vars]
lnkcolor = #e0e0e0
bgcolor = #202020
txtcolor = #d0d0d0
lnkdecoration = underline

In this example, those are made available in the templates as $lnkcolor,
$bgcolor, $txtcolor and $lnkdecoration .

Those template variables may also be set on the command line using the
--template-vars option.

Specifying album meta data
--------------------------

Each album can have defined some meta data such as name, description and
image shown on listing (note that not all themes use all of these).

Currently only supported format is borrowed from another album
generating tool - Matew. To add such metadata, create file
album_description in folder where you want to add metadata. Each line is
treated as one possible tag, unknown lines are simply ignored. Example
content of this file follow, I hope it is self explaining:

Album name "My album"
Album description "Description, which can be very long."
Album image identifier relative/path/to/image.jpg
